# Motor-Machine
Here we made a moving machine which is made up of several motors. We can add a new motor to the machine whenever we wish to.
We have full control over switching any motor on or off as well as increasing or decreasing the speed of each motor.
There are two parts (webpages) to the machine weâ€™re going to make:
1. One that has the switches and the controls of all the motors.
2. One that displays to us the health of the running machine.

part1:-
A new row is added with a new motor (its name will be in sequence, e.g.Motor001,Motor002..). 
This motor has all the functionalities of the previous motors and
the machine starts to record its speed as well every second.

part2:-
This is a separate page where we get to see the health of our machine. This page should
continuously update with values and machine status, as we switch on/off and control the speed of our
motors in the other page.
Motor Health is good if its speed is below or equal to 10.
If the speed become greater then 10 then there is fixmotor button there.
When a user clicks on this button, immediately the speed of that motor becomes the default speed,
which is 5 units. This should get reflected in our previous page as well where we were switching
on/off and controlling the speed of the motor.

I have uploade it on free webserver you can see from the given below:-
